inclusion: manual
name: ai-dev-os-scan
description: Scans ALL source files in the project against AI Dev OS guidelines. Unlike #ai-dev-os-check (which only checks git diff), this performs a full project-wide compliance scan. Use for initial audits, periodic full reviews, or after introducing new guidelines.

# AI Dev OS Full Project Scan

## Execution Flow

### 1. Parse AGENTS.md

Extract the list of guideline file paths from AGENTS.md.

### 2. Discover Target Files

If the user provides a directory or glob pattern, use that as the scope.
Otherwise, scan the entire project:

- Find all source files (e.g., `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go}`)
- Exclude common non-source directories: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `vendor/`
- Exclude files listed in `.gitignore`

### 3. Build Dynamic Mapping

Dynamically build the mapping between file patterns and guidelines.

Examples by tech stack:

- **Python**: `*.py` → code.md, naming.md, validation.md; `*/router.py` → security.md, cors.md; `*/models.py` → naming.md, validation.md; `*/schemas.py` → validation.md; `alembic/**` → naming.md
- **Next.js**: `*.tsx` → ui.md, form.md, code.md, naming.md; `app/**/page.tsx` → routing.md; `app/**/action.ts` → server-actions.md
- **Go**: `*.go` → code.md, naming.md, error-handling.md

### 4. Extract Check Items

Auto-detect check items from each guideline using the following keywords:

- "MUST", "MUST NOT", "PROHIBITED", "REQUIRED", etc.
- If frontmatter contains `checklist: [...]`, use that instead

If checklist templates exist in `.kiro/checklist-templates/` for the detected tech stack, load them as a reference.

### 5. Run Checks (Batch Processing)

Process files in batches to manage context window:

- Group files by directory or module
- For each batch:
  - Auto-check items detectable via static analysis
  - Flag items requiring judgment with ⚠️ for human review
- Track progress: "Scanning batch N/M..."

### 6. Aggregate Results

Combine results from all batches:

- Deduplicate violations
- Sort by severity (❌ violations first, then ⚠️ reviews)
- Group by guideline for pattern analysis

### 7. Report Output

Output in the following format:

```markdown
## AI Dev OS Full Project Scan Report

### Summary
- Total files scanned: N
- ✅ Passed: N / ⚠️ Review: N / ❌ Violation: N
- Compliance rate: N%

### Violations by Guideline
| Guideline | Violations | Files Affected | Most Common Issue |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|

### Top Violations
| # | File | Line | Rule | Guideline | Principle |
|---|------|------|------|-----------|-----------|

### Review Required
| File | Line | Item | Guideline |
|------|------|------|-----------|

### Hot Spots (Files with Most Violations)
| File | Violations | Reviews | Top Issues |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|

### Recommendations
1. [Priority: High] ...
2. [Priority: Medium] ...

### Why These Rules?
> Explains the rationale for the most frequent violations, tracing back to L2 principles → L1 philosophy
```

## Options

- Default: Scan all source files in the project
- Specify a directory: Scan only files under the specified directory (e.g., `src/features/auth`)
- Specify a glob: Scan files matching the pattern (e.g., `**/*.tsx`)
