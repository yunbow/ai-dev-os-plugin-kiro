# AI Dev OS Spiral Feedback (SECI Spiral)

## Execution Flow

### 1. Analyze Recent N Commits/PRs

- Aggregate past results from guideline checks
- Identify frequently occurring violation patterns
- Also detect patterns where "AI performed surprisingly well"

### 2. Abstract Patterns

Derive principles from individual cases:

- "auth() forgotten 3 times" → Strengthen principle "Authentication should be explicit, not implicit"
- "AI writes zod schemas accurately" → Confirm L3 rule is effective

### 3. Propose L1-L2 Updates

- Candidates for new principles
- Candidates for rewording existing principles
- Values discovered at the philosophy level

### 4. Report + Present Diff

Ask "Would you like to apply the following updates?" and apply after approval.
