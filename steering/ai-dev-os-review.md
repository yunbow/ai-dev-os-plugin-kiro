description: Performs a comprehensive self-review before creating a PR. Combines guideline compliance checking (L3) with design-level review (L2) and philosophical alignment (L1). Unlike #ai-dev-os-check which only checks rules, this also evaluates architecture decisions and code design quality.

# AI Dev OS Pre-PR Self-Review

## Execution Flow

### 1. Determine Base Branch

- Ask the user for the base branch (default: `main`)
- Get all changed files: `git diff [base]...HEAD --name-only`
- Get commit messages: `git log [base]...HEAD --oneline`

### 2. Parse AGENTS.md

Extract the list of guideline file paths from AGENTS.md.
Also load L1 philosophy and L2 principles files for design-level review.

### 3. L3 Guideline Compliance Check

Run the same checks as `#ai-dev-os-check`:

- Build file-to-guideline mapping
- Extract and verify check items
- Collect violations and review items

### 4. L2 Design Review

For each changed file, evaluate higher-level design concerns:

- **Single Responsibility**: Does each module/function have one clear purpose?
- **Dependency Direction**: Do dependencies flow correctly (inward, not outward)?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Is UI / business logic / data access properly separated?
- **Naming Intent**: Do names express domain concepts accurately?
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Is error handling consistent with L2 principles?
- **Testability**: Is the design easy to test?

### 5. L1 Philosophy Alignment

Check whether the overall change aligns with the project's core values:

- Does this change serve the stated philosophical goals?
- Are there trade-offs that conflict with core values?

### 6. PR Description Draft (Optional)

If the review passes, offer to draft a PR description:

- Summary of changes
- Design decisions and rationale
- Guideline compliance status

### 7. Report Output
