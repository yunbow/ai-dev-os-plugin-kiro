# AI Dev OS 4-Layer Health Audit

## Audit Items

### 1. Dependency Rules (Clean Architecture Principle)

- Do L1 files contain tool-specific terms? ("Kiro", "Claude Code", "Cursor", "Next.js", etc.)
- Do L2 files contain framework-specific implementation details?
- Is the one-way dependency L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 maintained?

### 2. Expiration Check

- L1: Last updated more than 5 years ago?
- L2: Last updated more than 3 years ago?
- L3: Last updated more than 12 months ago?
- L4: Last updated more than 4 months ago?
- Use `git log` to get the last update date for each file

### 3. Traceability

- Does each L3 guideline have a link to an L2 principle?
- Does each L4 AI Frame have a reference to an L3 guideline?
- Are there orphaned rules (not linked to any principle)?

### 4. Coverage

- Do all files referenced in AGENTS.md actually exist?
- Are there guidelines for the project's major file patterns?
- Are there mapped guidelines for each directory under src/?

### 5. Consistency

- Are there contradictory rules across multiple guidelines?
- Are naming conventions consistent across all files?
